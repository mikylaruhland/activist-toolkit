      Over 20,000 drug addicted babies are born in the US per year. (That is one baby every 25 minutes) Birth control is expensive and involves access to alot of resource3s many women dont have.Abortions are no longer accesible for most women and they are expensive. These factors have lead to an increasing rate of drug addicted babies being born in the US every year.

  <h3>
    Giving women who area adddicted to drugd access to proper long term birth control would lead to lower birth rates. THis would save the environment in the future and would also help save the women and the government money when they no longer need to treat the drug addicted babies being born. It would also drastically decrease the amount of children in the foster care system.
